iostat -xm 5 #io
vmstat 1 #cpu

QUICK SUMMARY
CPU time is the first thing to examine when looking at performance of an application.
The goal in optimizing code is to drive the CPU usage up (for a shorter period of time), not down.
Understand why CPU usage is low before diving in and attempting to tune an application.

QUICK SUMMARY
Monitoring disk usage is important for all applications. For applications that donât directly write to disk, system swapping can still affect their performance.
Applications that write to disk can be bottlenecked both because they are writing data inefficiently (too little throughput) or because they are writing too much data (too much throughput).


nicstat 5 # network

QUICK SUMMARY
For network-based applications, make sure to monitor the network to make sure it hasnât become a bottleneck.
Applications that write to the network can be bottlenecked both because they are writing data inefficiently (too little throughput) or because they are writing too much data (too much throughput).
