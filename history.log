iostat -xm 5 #io
vmstat 1 #cpu

QUICK SUMMARY
CPU time is the first thing to examine when looking at performance of an application.
The goal in optimizing code is to drive the CPU usage up (for a shorter period of time), not down.
Understand why CPU usage is low before diving in and attempting to tune an application.

QUICK SUMMARY
Monitoring disk usage is important for all applications. For applications that donât directly write to disk, system swapping can still affect their performance.
Applications that write to disk can be bottlenecked both because they are writing data inefficiently (too little throughput) or because they are writing too much data (too much throughput).


nicstat 5 # network

QUICK SUMMARY
For network-based applications, make sure to monitor the network to make sure it hasnât become a bottleneck.
Applications that write to the network can be bottlenecked both because they are writing data inefficiently (too little throughput) or because they are writing too much data (too much throughput).


JVM tools
jcmd 43483 PerfCounter.print

jconsole
Provides a graphical view of JVM activities, including thread usage, class usage, and GC activities
jhat
Reads and helps analyze memory heap dumps. This is a post-processing utility.
jmap
Provides heap dumps and other information about JVM memory usage. Suitable for scripting, though the heap dumps must be used in a post-processing tool.
jinfo
Provides visibility into the system properties of the JVM, and allows some system properties to be set dynamically. Suitable for scripting.
jstack
Dumps the stacks of a Java process. Suitable for scripting.
jstat
Provides information about GC and class loading activities. Suitable for scripting.
jvisualvm
A GUI tool to monitor a JVM, profile a running application, and analyze JVM heap dumps (which is a post-processing activity, though jvisualvm can also take the heap dump from a live program).
